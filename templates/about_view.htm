            <p>That would be me, no relations to the freedom fighter ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚!</p>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m a self taught programmer/game developer and a computer science student from Kenya. Iâ€™m so enthusiastic when 
                it comes to computers, science and all things tech related. I started Hto Studios because
                I enjoy reading and writing about tech and art and I also wanted
                to offer my development skills to the world. <br> You can view my work <a href="https://www.github.com/hthuku95">here</a>
